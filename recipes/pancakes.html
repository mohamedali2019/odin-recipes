    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat together milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the pan. Cook until bubbles form on top and the edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with syrup, butter, or fresh fruit.</li>
    </ol>
